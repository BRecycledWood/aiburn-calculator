API Integration Notes

OpenAI endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1/usage
Anthropic: No public usage API yet (placeholder in code)
Function proxies API key but doesn't store it
30-day usage window for exact mode

What Needs Work / TODO

Anthropic API support - Wait for public release, then implement in /api/usage.js
Featured ad rotation - Currently set to 10s interval, can adjust if needed
Twitter handle - Change @howstudio to actual handle in shareOnTwitter() function
Email address - Change ads@howstud.io to actual email throughout
Domain links - Update howstud.io references to final domain
Ad sponsors - Add actual sponsor data when deals are made (sponsor objects in AD_SLOTS)
Canvas download - Test on different browsers for PNG generation quality
Mobile optimization - Test responsive layout on actual mobile devices
Performance - Monitor bundle size, optimize if needed
Analytics - Consider adding tracking for calculator usage and ad impressions

Deployment

Target: Vercel at aiburn.howstud.io
Config: vercel.json specifies build command, output dir, and framework
Environment: No .env needed currently (API key is user-provided)
Build output: Goes to dist/ folder
Sticky sidebars: May need adjustment on small screens - test thoroughly

Key Files to Know

src/App.jsx - All logic, state, and UI (main component, ~750 lines)
api/usage.js - OpenAI/Anthropic proxy function
vite.config.js - Build configuration
index.html - Entry point, includes Tailwind CDN
src/index.css - Custom CSS (animations, scrollbar hiding)

Important State Variables

const [mode, setMode] = useState('quick') // 'quick' or 'exact'
const [selectedModel, setSelectedModel] = useState('GPT-4o')
const [monthlyTokens, setMonthlyTokens] = useState(10) // in millions
const [provider, setProvider] = useState('openai')
const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState('')
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
const [results, setResults] = useState(null)
const [error, setError] = useState('')
const [currentFeatureAd, setCurrentFeatureAd] = useState(0) // rotates featured ads

Key Functions

calculateCosts() - Computes Quick mode results
analyzeExactUsage() - Fetches OpenAI API data
shareOnTwitter() - Opens pre-filled tweet
downloadReport() - Generates PNG via Canvas
AdCard() - Renders ad slots (available or sponsored)

Next Person Notes: App is fully functional with professional 3-column layout. Main advertising real estate is properly balanced on both sides while keeping tool-focused content centered. Both sidebars are sticky for ad visibility. Ready for feature additions or deployment. Focus areas: Anthropic integration when API released, sponsor deals to fill ad slots, and mobile testing on actual devices for responsive behavior.
