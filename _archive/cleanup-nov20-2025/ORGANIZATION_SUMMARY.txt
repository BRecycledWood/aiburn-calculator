DECISION SUMMARY
================================================================================

13 MAJOR DECISIONS DOCUMENTED:

1.  ✅ Single component (App.jsx) vs multiple components
2.  ✅ React + Vite vs Next.js
3.  ✅ Tailwind CDN vs build-time CSS
4.  ✅ Hardcoded pricing for MVP (dynamic in Phase 2)
5.  ✅ 9 models (major providers only)
6.  ✅ 20-60-20 layout with ads
7.  ✅ Tiered ad pricing structure
8.  ✅ OpenAI API only (Anthropic awaiting public API)
9.  ✅ Client-side calculations (no backend database)
10. ✅ Vercel for hosting
11. ✅ Security-first approach (comprehensive audit before launch)
12. ✅ No backend persistence (MVP only)
13. ✅ Configuration placeholders (updated at launch)

4 BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED:

1. ✅ Anthropic API not available → Plan for Phase 2
2. ✅ Build size concerns → Resolved: 66.76 KB excellent
3. ✅ Security vulnerabilities → Fixed all 5 critical issues
4. ✅ Mobile testing not done → Responsive design verified, acceptable risk
