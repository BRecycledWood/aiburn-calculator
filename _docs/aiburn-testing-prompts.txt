**`ampcode`**! That's Anthropic's agentic coding tool. Let me give you the proper approach:

## Testing with ampcode

Here's the correct prompt structure for `ampcode`:

```bash
ampcode "I need you to prepare my AIBurn Calculator for launch. This is a single-page web app that calculates AI API costs for builders and founders.

TASKS:

1. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING:
   - Analyze the entire codebase and generate a complete test suite
   - Create unit tests for all calculation functions
   - Add integration tests for the price fetching mechanism
   - Generate end-to-end tests for user workflows
   - Test edge cases: zero values, extremely large numbers, invalid inputs, special characters
   - Add error handling tests
   - Create mobile responsiveness tests
   - Test ad placement and visibility

2. CODE REVIEW & BUG FIXES:
   - Identify and fix any bugs
   - Check for security vulnerabilities (XSS, injection attacks)
   - Optimize performance bottlenecks
   - Ensure proper error handling throughout
   - Validate all user inputs are sanitized

3. AUTO-UPDATE MECHANISM:
   - Implement or review the automatic price updating system
   - Create a script to fetch current AI API pricing from providers
   - Set up a GitHub Actions workflow (or similar) to run daily/weekly
   - Add error handling if price fetch fails (use cached prices)
   - Create a timestamp for 'last updated' display
   - Add tests for the price update mechanism

4. PRE-LAUNCH CHECKLIST:
   - Verify all calculations are accurate
   - Ensure responsive design works on all devices
   - Check SEO meta tags are complete
   - Validate accessibility (WCAG compliance)
   - Test ad integration
   - Set up error tracking
   - Add loading states and user feedback

5. DOCUMENTATION:
   - Create a README with setup instructions
   - Document the price update process
   - Add inline code comments where needed
   - Create a deployment checklist

Please implement all necessary changes, create all test files, and provide a summary of what was done."
```

## Focused Auto-Update Implementation with ampcode

```bash
ampcode "Implement an automatic price updating system for my AIBurn Calculator:

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Create a price fetching script (scripts/fetch-ai-prices.js) that:
   - Fetches current pricing from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.
   - Stores data in a JSON file (public/data/prices.json)
   - Includes error handling and retry logic
   - Logs update timestamp
   - Falls back to cached prices if fetch fails

2. Set up automated updates:
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/update-prices.yml)
   - Schedule to run daily at midnight UTC
   - Allow manual trigger
   - Commit updated prices automatically
   - Send notification if update fails (optional)

3. Frontend integration:
   - Load prices from JSON file on page load
   - Display 'last updated' timestamp
   - Show warning if prices are > 7 days old
   - Add manual refresh button for users

4. Testing:
   - Create tests for price fetching script
   - Test error scenarios (API down, invalid data)
   - Verify workflow configuration
   - Test frontend price loading

5. Monitoring:
   - Add logging for price updates
   - Create alerts for failed updates
   - Track price changes over time (optional)

Implement this complete system with all necessary files and configurations."
```

## Quick Pre-Launch Audit Command

```bash
ampcode "Perform a complete pre-launch audit and fix all issues in my AIBurn Calculator:

RUN ALL CHECKS:
✓ Functionality: Test all calculations and user inputs
✓ Security: Scan for XSS, CSRF, injection vulnerabilities  
✓ Performance: Check load times, optimize bundle size
✓ Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
✓ SEO: Meta tags, structured data, sitemap
✓ Mobile: Responsive design on all screen sizes
✓ Cross-browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
✓ Error handling: All edge cases covered
✓ Tests: Generate comprehensive test coverage
✓ Price accuracy: Verify all AI pricing data is current
✓ Ads: Test ad placement and visibility
✓ Analytics: Verify tracking is set up
✓ Legal: Privacy policy, terms, cookie consent

Fix all issues found, create missing tests, and generate a launch readiness report with any remaining action items."
```

## What ampcode Will Do

`ampcode` will:
1. **Read your entire codebase** automatically
2. **Generate and write test files** directly to your project
3. **Create new files** (like GitHub Actions workflows, price fetching scripts)
4. **Modify existing code** to fix bugs and add features
5. **Run tests** to verify everything works
6. **Provide a summary** of all changes made

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/aiburn-calculator

# Run comprehensive testing and setup
ampcode "Set up my AIBurn Calculator for launch with complete testing and auto-price updates"

# After ampcode finishes, review changes
git diff

# Run the tests ampcode created
npm test

# Deploy when ready
```

Would you like me to provide more specific prompts based on your tech stack (React, Vue, vanilla JS, etc.) or help you structure the auto-update mechanism in a particular way?
